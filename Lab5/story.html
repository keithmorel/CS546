    <h1>The Time I Deferred into the Playstation Club</h1>
    <main>
	<p>I have played console games throughout my life, starting with a Nintendo Gamecube, which I still own. In middle school, the big thing was the Xbox 360 and Call of Duty. A bunch of friends and I all bought Xbox 360s and the newest Call of Duty game at the time, Modern Warfare 2 (still the best IMO). We continuted playing on those 360s through the next several CoD games.</p>
	<p>When the Xbox One was announced and coming out, I was definitely going to buy it. Most of those friends also bought the Xbox One when it came out, but soon stopped playing. I continued playing games when they came out, but they were mostly singleplayer RPG-style games. I began playing PC games for all of my multiplayer gaming and my console gaming became mostly singleplayer.</p>
	<p>There were several games that have been coming out exclusively on the PS4 that I really wanted to play. Games like The Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc. were coming out that I wasn't able to play. This past year, when it came to Black Friday/Cyber Monday weeks I finally looked into getting a PS4 for like $100 off. I searched around for a long time to find the best deal and even enlisted my mom and my sister to help search. The PS4 was delivered back to my house and not my apartment here, so it was held until Christmas last year. I also got The Last of Us (Remastered) and Horizon Zero dawn as well, so all is good.</p>
