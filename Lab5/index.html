      <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>My name is Keith Morel. I am a junior computer science major interested in game development. I am the middle child in my family, with a younger sister Miranda and older brother Kyle. I was born in Morristown, NJ and lived in Booton, NJ until I was only a year old and we moved into our current house in Andover, NJ. That house was actually just recently put up for sale since my brother has graduated college and I will soon, so they don't need as big a house anymore.</p>
